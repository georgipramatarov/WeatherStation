# WeatherStation

The WeatherStation consists of multiple sensors, which are connected to a MQTT Broker(I am using cloudmqtt.com as the Broker, for its versatility) and all the readings are sent to an Android app.

Parts list:
Outdoor sensor - One Wire temperature sensor, Groove Multichannel Gas Sensor v1 and ESP32 dev board /n
Indoor sensor - Bosch BME680 sensor and an ESP8266
